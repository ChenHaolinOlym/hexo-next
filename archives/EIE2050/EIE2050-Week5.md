## Combinational Logic Circuits

In Sum-of-Products (SOP) form, basic combinational circuits can be directly implemented with AND-OR combinations if the necessary complement terms are available.

### SOP Circuits

SOP expression is an AND-OR combination of the input variables and the appropriate complements.

### AOI Circuits

When the output of a SOP form is inverted, the circuit is called an AND-OR-Invert circuit. The output expression can be changed to a POS expression by applying DeMorgan's Theorem twice.

### Exclusive-or Logic

The Boolean expression is $X = \overline{A}B + A\overline{B}$

### Exclusive-NOR Logic

The Boolean expression is $X = \bar{A}\bar{B} + AB$
