## Introduction

This course is about data structures and algorithms. Core question is: How to solve a problem effectively and efficiently.

## Data Structures

[d-Heap](/2019/09/26/note/CSC3100/CSC3100-Week5/#d-heap)

## Algorithms

**A problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.**

### Sorting Alogorithms

#### The Sorting Problem

Input a sequence of n numbers, and output a permutation of the input that is ordered from least to most.
