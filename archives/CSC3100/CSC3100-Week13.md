Minimum Spanning Tree

## Definitions

- Spanning Tree
  - A tree (i.e., connected, acyclic graph) which contains all the vertices of the graph

- Minimum Spanning Tree
  - Spanning tree with the **minimum sum of weights**

- Spanning forest
  - If a graph is not connected, then there is a spanning tree for each connected component of the graph

## Applications

- Find the least expensive way to connect a set of cities, terminals, computers, etc.

## Properties

- Minimum spanning tree is **not** unique

- MST has no cycles â€“ see why:
  - We can take out an edge of a cycle, and still have the vertices connected while reducing the cost

- \# of edges in a MST:
  - |V| - 1
