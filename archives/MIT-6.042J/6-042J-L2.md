## Proof by Contradiction

To prove proposition P is true, we assume P is false. Then use that hypothesis to derive a falsehood or contradiction.

## Induction

### Induction Axiom

Let P(n) be a predicate. If P(0) is true, and $\forall n \in N$ $(P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1))$ is true, then $\forall n \in N$, P(n) is true.

### Base Case(Basis Step)

The case where the induction started.

### Inductive Step

To show that from the Base Case on, every implication to the next is true.

### Induction Property

Induction may or may not give the reason why it's correct. In most cases it won't, it will just simply tells you the correctness of the answer.
