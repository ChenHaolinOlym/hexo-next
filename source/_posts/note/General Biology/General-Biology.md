## Introduction

**Biology is the scientific study of life.**

**Hypothesis:** 

- a tentative answer to a question or

- a proposed explanation for a set of observations.

**Theory:** 

- a comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence, and

- general enough to spin off many new testable hypotheses.

### Hypothesis-Driven Science

- Once a hypothesis is formed, an investigator can make predictions about what results are expected if that hypothesis is correct.

- We then test the hypothesis by performing an experiment to see whether or not the results are as predicted.

### The Properties of Life

1. Order

2. Regulation

3. Growth and development

4. Energy processing

5. Response to environment

6. Reproduction

7. Evolution

### Three Domains of Life

**Spicies:** A species is generally defined as a group of organisms that have the potential to ***interbreed*** with one another in nature to produce **healthy offspring**.

1. Bacteria

2. Archaea

3. Eukarya

Bacteria and Archaea have **prokaryotic cells**. Eukarya have **eukaryotic cells.**  

#### Kingdoms

The Domain Eukarya in turn includes three smaller divisions called **kingdoms:**

1. Kingdom Plantae

2. Kingdom Fungi

3. Kingdom Animalia

**Most members of the three kingdoms are multicellular.**

These three multicellular kingdoms are distinguished partly by how the organisms obtain food：

- Plants produce their own sugars and other foods by photosynthesis.
- Fungi are mostly decomposers, digesting dead organisms and organic wastes.
- Animals obtain food by ingesting and digesting other organisms.

**Those eukaryotes that do not fit into any of the three kingdoms fall into a catch-all group called the protists.**

- Most protists are single-celled; they include microscopic organisms such as amoebas

- But protists also include certain multicellular forms, such as seaweeds.

- Scientists are in the process of organizing protists into multiple kingdoms, although they do not yet agree on exactly how to do this.

### Major Themes in Biology

- Evolution
- Structure/Function
- Information Flow
- Energy Transformations
- Interconnection within Systems

#### Evolution

Evolution is the fundamental principle of life and the core theme that unifies all of biology.

The theory of evolution by natural selection, first described by **Charles Darwin** more than 150 years ago, is the one idea that makes sense of everything we know about living organisms.

##### The Darwinian View of Life

The evolutionary view of life came into focus in 1859 when Charles Darwin published ***On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection***.

**Natural selection** is the mechanism for descent with modification.

The product of **natural selection** is ***adaptation***, the accumulation of variations in a population over time. 

##### Observing Artifucial Selection

**Artificial selection** is the purposeful breeding of **domesticated** plants and animals by humans.

#### Structure/Function

Within biological systems, structure (the shape of something) and function (what it does) are often related, with each providing insight into the other.

Structure --- Anatomy
Function --- Physiology

#### Information Flow

For life’s functions to proceed in an orderly manner, information must be **stored**, **transmitted**, and **used**. 

#### Energy Transformations

- Various cellular activities of life are work, such as movement, growth, and reproduction, and work requires energy. 
- Life is made possible by the input of energy, primarily from the sun, and the transformation of energy from one form to another.

#### Interconnection within Systems

How life is studied at different scales?

The study of life extends from the microscopic scale of the molecules and cells that make up organisms
to the global scale of the entire living planet. 

## Cells

### Essential Chemistry of Biology

#### Basic Chemistry
##### Matters: Elements and Compounds

- Of the naturally-occurring elements, 25 are essential to humans.
- Four of these elements make up about 96% of the weight of the body. These four elements are Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen.
- Much of the remaining 4% is accounted for by 7 elements. 
  1. **Calcium**, important for building strong bones and teeth, is found abundantly in dairy products, sardines, and green, leafy vegetables.
  2. **Phosphorus**, a component of DNA, can be obtained by eating eggs, beans, and nuts. 
  3. **Potassium**
  4. **Sulfur**
  5. **Sodium**
  6. **Chlorine**
  7. **Magnesium**
- **Trace elements** are required in only very small amounts and essential for life.
  - An **Iodine** deficiency causes goiter.
  - **Fluorine** is added to dental products and drinking water and helps to maintain healthy bones and teeth.
