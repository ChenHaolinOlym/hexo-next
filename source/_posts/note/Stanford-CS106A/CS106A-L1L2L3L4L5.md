## Introduction

### Basic Structure

Change it after Karel finished.

```en
public class Name extends Karel {
    public void run() {
        command();
        ...
        command();
    }
}
```

### Indent

Java doesn't care about indent and space.

### Name and Identifiers

Java is case sensitive.

Your program's file must match exactly your class name.

Identifier: A name given to an item in your program.

### Comments

Syntax:

// comments, one line 

OR

/* comments
muliple lines*/

### Methods

#### Declaring a Method

```en
public void name() {
    statement;
    statement;
    ...
    statement;
}
```

#### Use Your Own Method

Just write down the method name with a parenthesis.

Note that you can use a method that is defined after.

#### Special Method Run

Every class should have a method run:

```en
public void run() {

}
```

The method which the name is "run" will be executed automatically.

If you don't have the method "run", there will be nothing done.

Just like "main" in C++

## Control Flow

### For Loop

```en
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
  statement;
  statement;
  statement;
  ...
  statement;
}
```

```en
for (initiallization; test; update) {
  statement;
  statement;
  statement;
  ...
  statement;
}
```

### If Statement

```en
if (Boolean Values) {
  statement;
} else if {
  statement;
} else {
  statement;
}
```

### While Loop

```en
while (Boolean Values) {
  statements;
}
```

## Console Programming

```en
public class Name extends ConsoleProgram {
  statement;
  ...
  statement;
}
```

### Commands

Commands | Usages
:-: | :-:
`println()` | print a line out

### Esacpes

Commands | Usages
:-: | :-:
`\"` | `"` When using `"` in a string
`\\` | `\`
`\t` | tab character
`\n` | new line character

### Expressions and Variables

#### Data Types

##### Primitive Types

Name | Description
:-: | :-:
int | integer
double | real numbers
char | single text characters
boolean | logical values

**Integer Division:** Java always rounds down to get an integer.

##### Mixing Types

When *int* and *double* is mixed, *double* will be the result.
When *string* and any other data type is mixed, a longer *string* will be the result.

##### Change Data Types

#### Variables

`(data type) name = xxx`

#### Logical Operators

Operator | Description
:-: | :-:
`&&` | and
`||` | or
`!` | not
