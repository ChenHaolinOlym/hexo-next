## Elementary Data Structures

### List

Some popular operations on List: printList, makeEmpty, find, insert, Delete, next, previous.

#### Array

- PrintList and Find implemented in O(N)
- Requires to estimate of the maximum size for memory allocation
- Insertion and Deletion are expensive

#### Linked-List

- Consist of a series of nodes(consist of data and reference)
- Not necessarily adjacent in memory
- Flexible on Insertion and Deletion
- Search in Linked List is nightmare

### Stack

- LIFO(Last In First Out) structure
- Access From Top
- Basic Operations: makeEmpty, pop, push, top, isEmpty

### Queue

- FIFO(First In First Out) structure
- Delete At The Front, Delete At The Rear
- Basic Operations: enqueue, dequeue

#### Application of Queues

Print jobs, computer networks, real-life waiting lines.
