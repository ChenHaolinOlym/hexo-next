Trees

## Definitions

- A tree is a collection of nodes.

- The collection can be empty .

- Otherwise, a tree consists of a distinguished node *r*, called root, and zero or more nonempty (sub) trees $T_1$, $T_2$, …$T_k$, each of whose roots are connected by a direct edge from *r*.

- A tree with *N* nodes has one root, and *N-1* edges 

### Root

The top most node of the tree.

### Edge

Nodes other than root in a tree.

### Parent

Node A is the parent of node B if B is the root of the left or right sub-tree of A.

### Child

Node B is the left (right) child of node A if A is the parent of B.

### Sibling

Node B and node C are siblings if they have the same parent.

### Leaf

A node is called a leaf if it has no children

### Path

A path from node $n_1$ to $n_k$: A sequence of nodes $n_1$, $n_2$, …, $n_k$ such that ni is the parent of $n_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i < k$.

#### Length of a path

- The length of this path is the number of edges on the path, namely k-1.

- Notice that in a tree, there is exactly one path from the root to each node.

### Depth

Depth of a node $n_i$ is the length of the unique path from the root to $n_i$. 

The root is at depth 0.

### Height

Height of $n_i$ is the length of the longest path from $n_i$ to a leaf.

All leaves are at height 0.

## Binary Tree

**A Binary Tree is a tree** in which no node can have more than two children (subtrees): $T_L$ and $T_R$, both of which could possibly be empty.

**Strictly Binary Tree:** Every non-leaf node in the tree has nonempty left and right sub-trees

**Complete (full) binary tree:**A complete binary tree of depth *d* is a strictly binary tree with all leaf nodes at level *d*.

### Expression Tree

$(a+b\times c) +((d\times e+f)\times g)$

1. The leaves of an expression tree are operands;

2. The other nodes contain operators.

### Traversing Strategy

#### Preorder (depth-first)

- Visit the node

- Traverse the left subtree in preorder

- Traverse the right subtree in preorder

#### Inorder

- Traverse the left subtree in inorder

- Visit the node

- Traverse the right subtree in inorder

#### Postorder

- Traverse the left subtree in postorder

- Traverse the right subtree in postorder

- Visit the node

## Binary Search Tree

**Tree representation:**

- A linked data structure in which each node is an object

**Node representation:**

- Key field

- Satellite data

- Left: pointer to left child

- Right: pointer to right child

- p: pointer to parent (p [root [T]] = NIL)

### Property

For every node, T, in the tree:

- the key values in its left subtree are *smaller than* the key value of T. 
- the key values in its right subtree are *larger than* the key value of T.

### Operations

Binary Tree support many dynamic set operations 

◦find, findMin, findMax, predecessor, successor, insert, delete
