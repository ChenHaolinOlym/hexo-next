## Data Structures

### Definitions

- Objects created to organize data used in computation
- Means of storing and organizing data to facilitate access and modifications.

### Several Common Data Structures

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Tree
- Graph

## Algorithms

### Definition

A problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

## Mathematics Review

All log are to be *base 2* unless specified otherwise.

### Iterated Logarithm

Iterated logarithm of n, written $\log ^{\*}n$(read "log star")

$$\log ^{\*}n:={\begin{cases}0&{\mbox{if }}n\leq 1;\\\\1+\log ^{\*}(\log n)&{\mbox{if }}n>1\end{cases}}$$

## Some Notations

### Mod

$7 % 3 = 2$

### Equivalence

$8 \equiv 15(mod 7)$
