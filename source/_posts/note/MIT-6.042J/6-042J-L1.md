## Definition of Proof

Proof on multiple fields: A method for ascertaining the truth.

Mathematicall Proof: A mathematical proof is a verification of a *proposition* by a chain of *logical deductions* from a set of *axioms*.

## Proposition

### Definitions

Proposition: A statement that is either true or false.
Predicate: Proposition whose truth depends on the value of variable(s)

### Implication

An implication p $\rightarrow$ q is true if **p is false or q is true**.
An iff p $\Leftrightarrow$ q is true if **p, q is both true or both false**

## Axioms

### Definition

An axiom is a proposition that is "assumed" to be truth.

### Principles

Axioms should be

1. Consistent
2. Complete

A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false.
A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false.

A set of such axioms is **not** possible to exist, it is proved by Godel.
