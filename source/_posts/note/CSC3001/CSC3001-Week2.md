## Set

### Basic Definitions

#### Definition

**Definition:** A set is an *unordered* collection of *distinct* objects.

Objects in a set is called *element* or *member*, and they are *contain* in the set.

#### Classical Sets

symbol | meaning
:-: | :-:
$Z$ | the set of all integers
$Z^{+}$ | the set of all positive integers
$Z^{-}$ | the set of all negative integers
$N$ | the set of all nonnegative integers
$R$ | the set of all real numbers
$Q$ | the set of all rational numbers
$C$ | the set of all complex numbers

#### Method to Define Set by Properties

${x \in A | P(x)}$ means that it is a set that its elements *x*, in A, such that x satisfies property P.
$|S|$ is defined as the number of elements contained in S.

#### Membership

$A \subseteq B$ $\leftrightarrow$ For any $x \in A$, $x \in B$
A = B $\leftrightarrow$ $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$
$A \subset B$ $\leftrightarrow$ $A \subseteq B$ and $A \ne B$

### Operations on Sets

#### Basic Operation

#### Union and Intersection of an Indexed Collection of Sets

#### Partitions of Sets

A collection of nonempty sets ${A_1, A_2, ..., A_n}$

Two equal standards, one in my phone.

#### Cartesian Products

### Set Identities

### Russell's Paradox
